## Understanding Exported Files

### What's Included in the Exported Files?

When you download the exported zip file from Imaginario AI, you'll find a comprehensive set of elements designed to enhance your Adobe Premiere editing experience. Here's what's included:

- **`.xml` File: Metadata Marvel**
  This file is a powerhouse of metadata, encapsulating details such as start and end timestamps, cropping positions, zoom settings, and more. It serves as the blueprint to recreate your clip on Adobe Premiere exactly as you crafted it on Imaginario AI.
  
- **.srt File: Captioning Simplicity**
  Unraveling simplicity, the .srt file provides captions adorned with timestamps. This feature ensures precise synchronization, facilitating an efficient editing workflow.
  
- **(Optional): `.mp4` File**
  If you opted to include the master file during the export process on Imaginario AI, you'll discover the `.mp4` file within the zip archive. This master file, when present, seamlessly integrates with the XML timeline in Adobe Premiere.

Understanding the contents of these files is key to unlocking the full potential of your exported clips. Let's dive into the steps to harness this power in Adobe Premiere.

If you opted to include the master file during the export from Imaginario AI, the XML timeline will automatically link to **[MASTER_FILE_NAME]** as long as it remains in the same folder as the `.xml` file.
In case the master file was not included during export, Adobe Premiere will prompt you to choose a master file from your local storage. Ensure that the selected master file has the filename **[MASTER_FILE_NAME]**.
